### Introduction
This project uses Telegram bot API as a front-end to provide the public (users) an interactive and easy way to learn about digital threats, and how they can adopt better cyber hygiene online for a safer experience. This is done with our bot quiz feature, where the bot would test and share some essentials on how to stay safe online.

Another core feature is the identity theft/breach function, which is powered by our backend technology. The user can provide the bot with his email address, and the backend infrastructure will do a search on internet databases to see if the user’s information and/or passwords were exposed, and advise them to change if so. This helps the user know if their passwords or information are exposed, and should be more wary. For example, if a user frequently uses password ‘abc12345’ for every website and if one website gets breached, his password would no longer be secure as people would know his username-password combination. Same goes for personal information, which may be used against the user in phishing or other forms of digital attacks.

### Motivation
Digital defence was just added as the fifth pillar of Singapore’s Total Defence last year. Safe to say, cyber security is a core concern for everyone in this interconnected world where people grow to become more accustomed to having their lives (e.g. social networks, communication, banking) on the internet. 

Just in recent years, we see the proliferation of identity theft and cyber scams. Especially during trying times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, where cyber criminals would engineer alarming headlines to deceive the public into clicking malicious links or installing malware.

We hope to make an application that can help users adopt better cyber-hygiene and enjoy a safer experience on the internet.

### Use Case / User Stories
1. As a person with many accounts on various websites, I would like to check if my personal information is **leaked** online.
2. As a non-tech savvy person, I want to know how I can better **secure** my personal data online.
3. As a business owner, I want to know the importance of cybersecurity and how it can leave a negative impact on my business if I were to neglect it.
4. As an educator, I am looking for a fun, engaging, and reliable platform for my students to pick up good **cyber hygiene** by themselves during their free time.
5. As a CIO of an organization, I would want my users to adopt better cyber hygiene by encouraging them to learn more through SecureMe. 
6. When I am bored, I can have a chatbot like SecureMe sending me memes, while at the same time reminding me to stay safe online through its various features.

### Competitiveness / How are we different from other platforms?
**Ease of use & widely accessible** - No need to go through a complicated registration process which may be difficult for non-tech savvy users. Just open up Telegram and the bot is just a few clicks away. All features are on the backend with Telegram chatbot serving as an intuitive front end for all users.

**Free for all!** - Unlike services out there which usually require registration and payment, our service is completely free! We leverage cloud hosting and Telegram Chat Bot API to make this possible and accessible to everyone. Imagine a service asking a typical internet user to pay, it would deter many potential users. Encouraging users to adopt good cyber hygiene should not be a paid commodity. 

**Fun to use** - Unlike services out there which may be loaded with sophisticated technology jargons, we keep our chatbot as a friendly mascot like figure that explains information security in an easy to understand layman manner to people, with the assumption that they know little. We also try to keep a friendly atmosphere through the chat-bot using emojis and engaging texts.
